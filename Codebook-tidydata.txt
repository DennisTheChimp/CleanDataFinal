More information about the study and the resulting datafiles can be found in ./UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt and ./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt

The file tinydata.txt combines the measurement results of two groups in the study, the training and test group, and adds data for subject and activity to that.

Factor variables:
	activity - type of activity carried out during the measurements
	subject - id number (1-30) of each participant

Measurement variables
	- Selected from the original data were only those variables that represent a calculated mean or standard deviation of a measurement.
	- In the dataset you find the mean of these values, averaged by subject and activity
	- A complete description of all the measurement variables can be found in ./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt
	- The names of the variables were not changed, so the mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-X is still called tBodyAcc-mean()-X
